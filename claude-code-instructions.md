# Instructions for Claude Code

## Context
I have a comprehensive content improvements document based on a professional content audit of lawsonscreative.co.uk. The improvements are prioritised into 3 tiers and ready to implement.

## Your Task
Implement all content improvements from the file `lawsons-creative-content-improvements.md` into the lawsonscreative-main-site repository.

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Homepage Priority 1 (Do First)
1. **Hero Section** - Replace headline, subheading, and supporting paragraph with new copy
2. **Benefits Row** - Replace the current 7 vague benefits with 3 sharp, proof-backed benefits
3. **"This is Just the Beginning" Paragraph** - Replace with reframed version
4. **Pricing Section** - Add "Why the price ranges?" explainer above cards and VAT disclaimer in each card
5. **FAQ Section** - Replace all 10 FAQ answers with the new detailed versions (ensure accordions still work)

### Phase 2: Supporting Pages
6. **About Page** - Add new "Who I work best with" section before final CTA
7. **How We Work Page** - Add new "How payments and communication work" section after the 4-step process
8. **Services Page** - Add pricing explainer and VAT note at top of pricing section

### Phase 3: Site-Wide Polish
9. **CTA Standardisation** - Update all CTAs to use "Book a free consultation" (primary) and "Get a quote by email" (secondary)
10. **Page Titles** - Update all `<title>` tags and meta titles per the document
11. **Contact Form** - Add helper text to fields and reassurance text above submit button

## Important Notes

- All new copy is in the content improvements document - don't write your own versions
- Maintain all existing functionality (FAQ accordions, responsive design, etc.)
- Keep all existing styling/classes - this is content only, not a redesign
- Test FAQs expand/collapse after implementation
- Ensure mobile responsiveness is maintained
- All prices should say "ex VAT" or "exclude VAT"

## After Implementation

Create a checklist of what was changed and flag anything that needs my review.
