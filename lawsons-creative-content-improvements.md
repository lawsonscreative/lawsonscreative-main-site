## PRIORITY 1: Direct Conversion Impact (Do These First)

### 1. Hero Section - Complete Rewrite

#### Current Hero:
```
Websites that grow your business
Professional, fast and effective websites for small to medium sized businesses. Built in weeks, not months.
```

#### NEW Hero Headline:
```
Websites that actually win you customers
```

#### NEW Hero Subheading:
```
Modern, fast-loading websites for UK service businesses — designed to build trust and generate enquiries. Typically delivered in 1–2 weeks, without the agency price tag.
```

#### NEW Hero Supporting Paragraph:
```
You're great at what you do. Your website should show it. I build strategy-led sites that turn visitors into bookings, not just "pretty" homepages.
```

---

### 2. Icon Benefits Row - Streamlined to Three Sharp Benefits

#### Current (repetitive and vague):
- Fast delivery
- Great value
- 5-star service
- Fast delivery (again)
- From £500
- Mobile-friendly websites
- Secure and fast

#### NEW - Three Proof-Backed Benefits:

**⚡ Launched in 1–2 weeks**  
Streamlined process, clear deadlines. You get your site when you need it, not when an agency's calendar opens up.

**💷 From £500 (ex VAT)**  
Transparent fixed-price packages, no surprise invoices. You know exactly what you're paying before we start.

**⭐ Clients see more enquiries**  
Real small businesses with measurable results. Modern websites that convert visitors into customers.

---

### 3. "This is Just the Beginning" Paragraph - Reframe Weakness as Strength

#### Current:
```
This is just the beginning. We're building a portfolio of stunning, effective websites across industries. From fitness coaches to wedding photographers, car detailers to accountants.
```

#### NEW:
```
We're currently partnering with pet care, fitness, trades, creative and professional service businesses — with new projects launching every month. You won't be project number 312 lost in a big agency; you'll get direct attention from the person actually building your site.
```

---

### 4. Pricing Section - VAT Clarity

#### Add Above the Package Cards:
```
**Why the price ranges?**  
Each package has a price range because every business is slightly different. We'll give you a fixed quote after a short discovery call — no surprises.
```

#### Add to Each Package Card (Footer Note):
```
*Prices exclude VAT. Final cost depends on number of pages and any custom features — we'll confirm everything upfront.*
```

---

### 5. FAQ Section - Complete Answers

**Location:** Homepage, "Common questions" section  
**Note:** These are currently collapsible accordions. Need to ensure answers are visible/accessible.

#### Question 1: How long does it take to build a website?

**Current Answer:**
```
Most projects take 1–2 weeks from kickoff to launch, depending on the package and complexity. We'll give you a detailed timeline during the discovery call.
```

**IMPROVED Answer:**
```
Most projects take 1–2 weeks from kickoff to launch, depending on the package and complexity. Starter packages typically take 1 week. Professional packages take 1–2 weeks. Premium packages take 2 weeks.

The main factors that affect timeline are: how quickly you can provide content (photos, copy, testimonials), how many rounds of revisions you need, and whether you need custom integrations.

We'll give you a detailed timeline with clear milestones during the discovery call, so you always know what's happening next.
```

---

#### Question 2: Do you offer payment plans?

**NEW Answer:**
```
Yes, we offer flexible payment options for all packages:

**Option 1:** 50% deposit to start, 50% on launch  
**Option 2:** Three monthly payments (for Professional and Premium packages)

All payment terms are agreed upfront before we start work. We accept bank transfer, debit card, and credit card payments.

For established businesses or repeat clients, we're happy to discuss custom payment arrangements.
```

---

#### Question 3: What if I need changes after launch?

**NEW Answer:**
```
Every package includes post-launch revisions:
- Starter: 1 round of revisions
- Professional: 2 rounds of revisions  
- Premium: 3 rounds of revisions + 30 days priority support

After launch, you have several options for ongoing changes:

**DIY:** I'll train you on how to make basic content updates yourself (most clients find this easy)

**Maintenance package:** £50–£150/month for regular updates, security, backups, and small changes

**Pay-as-you-go:** £75/hour for one-off content updates or new pages

Most clients find they need very little help after launch, but I'm here when you need me.
```

---

#### Question 4: Do I need to provide the content, or do you write it?

**NEW Answer:**
```
It depends on your package and preferences:

**You provide content (most common):**  
You know your business best. I'll give you a simple content template that tells you exactly what I need (text, photos, testimonials). Most clients find this straightforward.

**I help with content (Professional & Premium):**  
I'll review your existing content and suggest improvements. I can restructure copy to be clearer and more compelling, though you'll still need to provide the core information about your services.

**Full copywriting (add-on service):**  
If you don't have time or prefer professional copywriting, I can recommend trusted copywriters who specialise in small business websites. This typically adds £300–£800 depending on the number of pages.

The key thing: Your website will only be as good as the content. I'll help you get it right.
```

---

#### Question 5: What about hosting? Do I need to arrange that?

**NEW Answer:**
```
No, you don't need to worry about hosting — I'll handle everything.

**What's included:**
- Fast, secure hosting on modern platforms (Vercel or Netlify)
- Free SSL certificate (the padlock in the browser)
- Automatic backups
- 99.9% uptime guarantee
- Your custom domain setup (if you have one)

**Ongoing costs:**
- Most sites: £0/month (covered in your build cost for the first year)
- High-traffic or e-commerce sites: £10–30/month (I'll let you know upfront if this applies)

After the first year, hosting is typically £50–150/month as part of a maintenance package, or you can manage it yourself (I'll show you how).

No technical knowledge needed — I handle all the technical stuff so you can focus on your business.
```

---

#### Question 6: Can I update the website myself after it's built?

**NEW Answer:**
```
Absolutely! Every website includes:

**Training session:** I'll show you how to make common updates (text changes, adding images, updating prices, adding blog posts)

**Documentation:** Simple step-by-step guides for common tasks

**CMS access:** You'll have full control via a user-friendly content management system

**Most common updates are easy:**
- Changing text or prices: 2–3 minutes
- Adding photos to a gallery: 5 minutes  
- Publishing a blog post: 10 minutes

**For bigger changes** (new pages, layout changes, new features), you can either:
- Do it yourself if you're comfortable
- Ask me to help (£75/hour or included in maintenance package)

95% of clients feel confident making their own updates after the training session.
```

---

#### Question 7: Why shouldn't I just use Wix or Squarespace?

**NEW Answer:**
```
Great question — DIY builders are fantastic for some businesses, but they come with trade-offs:

**DIY builders (Wix, Squarespace, etc.):**
✅ Cheap upfront (£10–30/month)  
✅ You have full control  
❌ Takes 20–40 hours of your time to learn and build  
❌ Often look "templated" (your site looks like 10,000 others)  
❌ Slower loading speeds (affects Google rankings)  
❌ Limited customisation without coding knowledge  
❌ DIY usually means "good enough", not "great"

**Working with Lawsons Creative:**
✅ Professional, custom design that stands out  
✅ Optimised for speed and Google rankings  
✅ Done in 1–2 weeks (not months of your evenings)  
✅ Strategy included (what pages do you actually need? What should visitors do?)  
✅ I've built dozens of sites — you benefit from that experience  

**The real question:** What's your time worth? If you can earn £500–£2,000 in the 20–40 hours it takes to build a DIY site, hiring me makes financial sense.

Plus, your website is often the first impression potential customers get. Is "good enough" really good enough?
```

---

#### Question 8: Do you do e-commerce websites?

**NEW Answer:**
```
Yes, but with some caveats:

**Simple e-commerce (1–10 products):** Absolutely. This fits within the Premium package. I can integrate payment processing, product pages, and a simple shopping cart.

**Medium e-commerce (10–50 products):** Yes, but this typically requires a custom quote (£3,000–£6,000) depending on complexity, inventory management needs, and integrations.

**Large e-commerce (50+ products, complex variants):** Probably not the best fit. At this scale, you'd benefit from a specialist e-commerce agency or platform like Shopify Plus.

**The key question:** What are you selling, and how complex is the inventory?

Book a free consultation and we'll discuss whether e-commerce is right for your needs, or if there's a simpler solution (like taking enquiries instead of payments).
```

---

#### Question 9: What if I already have a website?

**NEW Answer:**
```
Perfect — most of my clients do. Here's how it works:

**Redesign (most common):**  
I'll build your new site from scratch while your old site stays live. When the new site is ready and you're happy with it, we make the switch. Zero downtime.

**Improvements to existing site:**  
If you like your current site but want specific improvements, I can work with your existing platform. However, if it's built on outdated technology, a full rebuild is often faster and cheaper than trying to fix legacy issues.

**What happens to my old site?**  
- Your old site stays live until the new one launches
- I can migrate your content (blog posts, testimonials, etc.)
- I can set up redirects so your Google rankings aren't affected

**SEO concerns?**  
Don't worry — I'll set up proper redirects and make sure your new site is even better optimised than your old one. Most clients see improved Google rankings within 2–3 months.
```

---

#### Question 10: What makes you different from other web designers?

**NEW Answer:**
```
Fair question. Here's what makes Lawsons Creative different:

**1. I'm a small business owner building sites for small businesses**  
I understand tight budgets, cashflow concerns, and the pressure to generate ROI quickly. Large agencies often don't.

**2. Speed without sacrificing quality**  
I use modern tools and efficient processes to deliver in 1–2 weeks. Most agencies take 6–12 weeks for the same result.

**3. Strategy first, design second**  
Beautiful websites that don't generate enquiries are expensive art projects. I focus on what actually drives bookings: clear messaging, trust signals, and easy next steps.

**4. Transparent pricing**  
You know the price before we start. No scope creep, no surprise invoices, no "oh by the way, that'll be extra."

**5. You work directly with me**  
No account managers, no junior designers, no outsourcing. I design it, I build it, I support it.

**6. Built for the long term**  
I use modern, maintainable technology. Your site won't be outdated in 6 months, and you won't be locked into expensive ongoing contracts.

I'm not the cheapest option (there are plenty of £200 Fiverr designers), and I'm not the most expensive (£10k agencies exist). I'm the "Goldilocks" option for small businesses who want quality without overpaying.
```

## PRIORITY 2: Trust & Authority

### 6. About Page - Add "Who I Work Best With" Section

**Location:** About page  
**Add as new section before final CTA**

#### New Section:

**Heading:**
```
Who I work best with
```

**Content:**
```
Lawsons Creative is built for UK service businesses who:

✅ **Want results, not just pretty websites**  
You care about bookings, enquiries, and revenue — not just "looking good online."

✅ **Value speed and efficiency**  
You need your website done in weeks, not months. You don't have time for endless meetings and revisions.

✅ **Appreciate transparency**  
You want clear pricing, honest timelines, and straightforward communication. No jargon, no surprises.

✅ **Are ready to invest properly**  
You understand that professional websites cost more than £200, but you don't want to pay agency prices (£10k+) either.

✅ **Know what they do (even if they can't explain it yet)**  
You're established enough to know your services, your customers, and your value. I'll help you articulate it clearly.

**Not a good fit?** That's okay too. If you need a £200 basic site, there are great Fiverr designers. If you need a £50k enterprise platform, there are excellent agencies. I'm the middle ground — quality without overpaying.

**Sound like you?** [Book a free consultation](/contact) and let's talk about your project.
```

### 7. How We Work Page - Add "Payments & Communication" Section

**Location:** How We Work page  
**Add as new section after the 4-step process**

#### New Section:

**Heading:**
```
How payments and communication work
```

**Content:**
```
### Payment structure

**All packages follow the same payment schedule:**
1. **50% deposit** — Required to book your project and start discovery work
2. **50% on launch** — Due when your site goes live and you're happy with it

**Payment plans available:** For Professional and Premium packages, we can split payments across 3 months. All terms agreed upfront.

**Payment methods:** Bank transfer, debit card, credit card. Invoices include full VAT breakdown (Lawsons Enterprises Ltd is VAT registered).

---

### Communication & updates

**During the project:**
- **Primary contact:** Email for all project communication (responses within 24 hours on weekdays)
- **Quick questions:** WhatsApp or text for urgent queries
- **Review sessions:** 2–3 scheduled video calls (discovery, design review, pre-launch)

**You'll always know what's happening:**
- Clear project timeline with milestones at the start
- Regular progress updates (typically every 2–3 days)
- Shared workspace where you can see the site being built
- No "black box" development — you're involved as much or as little as you want

**After launch:**
- Training session to show you how to make updates
- 30-day email support (Premium package) or ongoing support via maintenance package
- Response times: 24–48 hours for questions, 1 week for change requests

---

### What I need from you

**To keep the project on track, you'll need to provide:**

✅ **Content within 3 days of project start:**  
Text, photos, testimonials, pricing, contact details. I'll send you a simple template.

✅ **Timely feedback:**  
When I send mockups or drafts, aim to respond within 2–3 days. Delays in feedback mean delays in launch.

✅ **Access to existing accounts:**  
Domain registrar, hosting (if migrating), email, analytics. I'll tell you exactly what I need.

✅ **One main point of contact:**  
"Design by committee" slows things down. Ideally one person makes final decisions.

**Don't have content ready?** That's fine — we can push your start date back. I'd rather wait for good content than rush with placeholder text.

---

### What happens if we need to pause or cancel?

**Life happens. Here's the policy:**

- **Before work starts:** Full refund of deposit, no questions asked
- **During discovery/design:** 50% refund (covers time spent)
- **During build:** No refund of deposit, but you own all work completed to that point
- **After launch:** Full payment due, but we can discuss payment plans if needed

I want happy clients, not trapped clients. If it's not working out, let's talk.
```

## PRIORITY 3: Polish & Final Touches

### 8. Services Page - Bullet Formatting & VAT Note

**Location:** Services/Packages page

#### Add at Top of Pricing Section:
```
**Understanding our pricing ranges**

Each package has a price range because every business is slightly different. The final cost depends on:
- Number of pages required
- Complexity of content (simple text vs galleries, videos, forms)
- Custom features or integrations
- Whether you provide content or need help creating it

**All prices exclude VAT.** We'll give you a fixed quote after a short discovery call — no surprises, no hidden fees.
```

#### Package Bullet Improvements

**Ensure consistent formatting:**
- Use clear, scannable bullets
- Each feature on its own line
- Bold key features like "Mobile-responsive design" and "Advanced SEO optimisation"
- Use "✓" or "✔" for included features
- No repetitive text between packages

---

### 9. Standardised CTA Language

**Current CTAs are inconsistent. Standardise across the site:**

#### Primary CTA (Main action):
```
Book a free consultation
```

#### Secondary CTA (Less committal):
```
Get a quote by email
```

#### Use "Book a free consultation" in:
- Hero section (primary button)
- End of About page
- End of How We Work page
- End of Portfolio page
- Services page (primary CTA)
- Footer

#### Use "Get a quote by email" or "Send my project details" in:
- Contact form button
- Services page (secondary CTA for those not ready to call)

#### Button microcopy (add near buttons):
```
No spam, no pushy sales — just an honest conversation about whether I can help.
```

---

### 10. Page Titles (SEO Improvements)

**Current page titles are generic. Update to:**

#### Homepage:
```
Web Design for Small Businesses in the UK | Lawsons Creative
```

#### Services:
```
Web Design Packages & Pricing for Small Businesses | Lawsons Creative
```

#### Portfolio:
```
Web Design Portfolio – Small Business Websites | Lawsons Creative
```

#### How We Work:
```

```

#### About:
```
About Lawsons Creative – Web Design for UK Small Businesses
```

#### Contact:
```
Get a Free Website Quote | Contact Lawsons Creative
```

---

### 11. Contact Form - Helper Text

**Add helper text to key fields:**

#### Current Website URL field:
```
(If you don't have one yet, just leave this blank)
```

#### Budget Range field:
```
(This helps me recommend the right package. We'll always confirm a fixed quote before starting)
```

#### Project Timeline field:
```
(If you're not sure, choose "Just exploring" and we'll talk it through)
```

#### Submit button reassurance (add above button):
```
No spam, no pushy sales — just an honest conversation about whether I can help.
```
